# Payment-Application

This Project was required by udacity while studying my nannodegree in embedded systems

Here are the requirments

Project Introduction:
Payment systems are now available everywhere and everyone interacts with these systems every day.
There are different types of transactions you can make, SALE, REFUND, Pre-Authorization, and VOID.

SALE: means to buy something and its price will be deducted from your bank account.
REFUND: this means that you will return something and wants your money back to your bank account.
Pre-Authorization: means holding an amount of money from your account, e.g Hotel reservation.
VOID: this means canceling the transaction, e.g if the seller entered the wrong amount.


You are required to implement the SALE transaction only by simulating the card, terminal(ATM), and the server.
